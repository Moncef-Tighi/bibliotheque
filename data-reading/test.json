{"author":"Carlotta R. Anderson","bookformat":"Hardcover","desc":"\"All-American Anarchist\" chronicles the life and work of Joseph A. Labadie (1850-1933), Detroit's prominent labor organizer and one of early labor's most influential activists. A dynamic participant in the major social reform movements of the Gilded Age, Labadie was a central figure in the pervasive struggle for a new social order as the American Midwest underwent rapid industrialization at the end of the 19th century. This engaging biography follows Labadie's colorful career from a childhood among a Pottawatomi tribe in the Michigan woods through his local and national involvement in a maze of late 19th-century labor and reform activities, including participation in the Socialist Labor party, Knights of Labor, Greenback movement, trades councils, typographical union, eight-hour-day campaigns, and the rise of the American Federation of Labor. In writing this biography of her grandfather, Carlotta R. Anderson consulted the renowned Labadie Collection at the University of Michigan, a unique collection of protest literature which extensively documents pivotal times in American labor history and radical history.","genre":"Labor,History","img":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1356461214l/1001079.jpg","isbn":"814327079","link":"https://goodreads.com/book/show/1001079.All_American_Anarchist","pages":"324","rating":"3.83","title":"All-American Anarchist: Joseph A.
